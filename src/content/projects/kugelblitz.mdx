Kugelblitz is a framework for exploring the design space of programmable hardware protocol 
processing architectures. Specifically it enables comparing quantitative overall system 
performance, energy consumption, chip area, and flexiblity for different hardware architectures 
with varying degrees of programmability. Kugeblitz separates abstract protocol representations 
from concrete hardware configurations, and contains tools for building concrete RTL 
implementations from hardware configurations, simulating them, and compiling abstract 
protocols for specific hardware configurations. We then use ASIC synthesis tools to get 
the area/timing numbers, and end-to-end simulation with SimBricks for full system performance 
measurements.
